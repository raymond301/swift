    <p><strong>Retention Spread </strong>is the middle part of the retention time.&nbsp;One quarter of the peptides elute earlier; one quarter  of the peptides elute later. One half of the peptides elute during the Retention Spread period. </p>
    <p>This is the period where the peptides are eluting the closest together. It is this critical time period that most stresses the LC system's ability to separate peptides.</p>
    <p>Greater <strong>Retention Spread</strong> means that the peptides elute over a longer period of time which in turn indicates better separation of peaks. </p>

    <div class="heading">Units:</div>
    <p><strong> Minutes (min)</strong>
    </p><div class="heading">Optimal:</div>
    <p><strong>Higher:</strong> The more spread out the eluting peptides, the more time is available to trigger MS2 spectra and the more likely it is to identify more spectra.
    </p>
    <p>The most reproducible <strong>LC-MS</strong> performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric means your process is not reproducible.
    </p>
    <div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div>
    <p>An ideal standard protein sample will have peptides that elute over a range of times that is similar to times when peptides from biologically significant samples elute. Typically  with reverse phase chromatography, there are only a relatively few hydrophilic peptides that elute early and relatively few hydrophobic peptides that elute late. The bulk of the peptides elute in the middle during the <strong>Retention Spread</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>A change in <strong>Retention Spread </strong>may indicate that the gradient has changed. For example, because the buffers have changed, the time it takes for the middle 50% of peptides to elute increases; blockages in LC system can cause <strong>Retention Spread</strong> to lengthen; improper solvent mixing can also increase or decrease <strong>Retention Spread</strong>.</p>
    <div class="heading">Related Metrics: </div>
    <p>Since this is the most critical region of the LC run, the <strong>Retention Spread</strong> is used as the basis for the calculation of a number of other metrics. The metrics<a href="peptides_per_minute.php"> Peptides per Minute, </a><a href="spray_instability.php">Spray Instability</a>,<a href="ms1_peak_intensity.php"> Peak Intensity</a>,<a href="ms1_total_ion_current.php"> Total Ion Current,</a> <a href="ms1_dynamic_range.php"> Dynamic Range</a>, <a href="ms1_spectra.php">MS1 Spectra</a> and <a href="ms2_spectra.php">MS2 Spectra</a> are all measured over the <strong>Retention Spread </strong>period of the elution curve.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="peptides_per_minute.php">Peptides per Minute</a> metric is calculated by dividing by the <strong>Retention Spread</strong>. If <strong>Retention Spread </strong>is very small,<a href="peptides_per_minute.php"> Peptides per Minute</a> will be meaningless. If very few peptides are detected (low<a href="peptide_count.php"> Peptide Count</a>), then the <strong>Retention Spread</strong> metric may be unreliable.
