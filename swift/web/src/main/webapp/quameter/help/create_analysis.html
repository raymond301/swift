        How To Create An Analysis
    </div>
    <p>
        We recommend you choose to run through the
        <strong>
            Tutorial
        </strong>
        to familiarize yourself with the look and feel of
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        . Whether you go through the
        <strong>
            Tutorial
        </strong>
        , you will eventually come to a point where you will be able view some sample data or load your own
        <strong>
            ThermoÂ® Data Dependent Analysis (DDA) MS/MS *.raw
        </strong>
        data.

    <p>
        In this first example, the
        <strong>
            Tutorial
        </strong>
        was closed and you have the opportunity to view
        <strong>
            pre-loaded data
        </strong>
        . We have some
        <strong>
            sample data
        </strong>
        in
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        for you to use to get familiar with how the tool works. You land in the
        <strong>
            Dashboard
        </strong>
        first. This is where you can view the
        <strong>
            Latest Run
        </strong>
        compared to
        <strong>
            all runs
        </strong>
        .

        <img alt="After The Tutorial Is Closed" height="110" src="new_images/skip_tutorial.png" width="651"/>

    <p>
        Before you load your own data, you must change the
        <strong>
            Organization
        </strong>
        ,
        <strong>
            Lab
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
            Instrument
        </strong>
        to the profile you created during the signup process:

    <p>
        <img alt="Choose Instrument" height="348" src="new_images/choose_instrument.png" width="537"/>

    <p>
        After you choose your instrument, you will click the
        <strong>
            Load Data
        </strong>
        tab and
        <strong>
            Create an Analysis
        </strong>
        . This process of
        <strong>
            Creating an Analysis
        </strong>
       <span id="BugEvents">
        is important because  it specifies what the protein (s) is (are) in the standard, the modifications on these proteins, and  how the data should be searched
       </span>
        with
        <a href="http://massqc.proteomesoftware.com/help/faq/OMSSA.html">
            OMSSA
        </a>
        or
        <a href="http://massqc.proteomesoftware.com/help/faq/SpectraST.html">
            SpectraST
        </a>
        .

    <p>
        <img alt="Create an Analysis" height="261" src="new_images/create_analysis.png" width="682"/>

    <p>
        You will then be prompted to choose the type of
        <strong>
            standard
        </strong>
        you wish to load. There is currently one option:
        <strong>
            Simple.
        </strong>
        And example of a simple standard is
        <strong>
            BSA
        </strong>
        or a simple mixture of
        <strong>
            several proteins.
        </strong>
        If the wrong
        <strong>
            standard
        </strong>
        is used or
        <strong>
            modifications
        </strong>
        assigned incorrectly, your search results may be false and the analysis will be misleading.

    <p>
        After you click
        <strong>
            Next
        </strong>
        , you will be prompted to choose a
        <strong>
            standard
        </strong>
        . You can either choose a
        <strong>
            predefined standard
        </strong>
        or create a
        <strong>
            new standard
        </strong>
        . There are a list of common
        <strong>
            standards
        </strong>
        that are routinely used in
        <strong>
            LC-MS/MS QC analysis
        </strong>
        . These are listed in the drop down menu,
        <strong>
            Standard:
        </strong>

    <p>
        <img alt="Choose New Standard" height="531" src="new_images/new_standard.png" width="628"/>

    <p>
        After you click the create a
        <strong>
            new standard
        </strong>
        , you have the option to name a new standard or choose one from a database:

    <p>
        <img alt="Name Your Standard" height="531" src="new_images/name_your_standard.png" width="628"/>

    <p>
        You must choose a standard from the database and then add it the list above. Then you can name your standard. A
        common way to name your standard is to append your lab name or initials to
        <strong>
            "BSA"
        </strong>
        so you know what standard you are using:

    <p>
        <img alt="Select Proteins and Click Next" height="532" src="new_images/select_proteins.png" width="628"/>

    <p>
        You will then be prompted to choose
        <strong>
            modifications
        </strong>
        for your standard protein:

    <p>
        <img alt="Choose Modifications" height="531" src="new_images/choose_mods.png" width="628"/>

    <p>
        When you are finished choosing modifications, you can click next for the summary. Once you have completed this
        process, click
        <strong>
            Done
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        will create your default standard.

    <p>
        <img alt="Summary of Standard Information" height="531" src="new_images/standard_summary.png" width="628"/>

    <p>
        MassQC has now been configured so that you can load your own
        <strong>
            *.raw files
        </strong>
        for analysis:
