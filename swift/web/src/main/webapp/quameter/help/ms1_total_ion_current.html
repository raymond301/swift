   <p><strong>Total Ion Current</strong> <strong>(TIC)</strong>  estimates the total signal available in the mass spectrometer.&nbsp;</p>
   
   <p>Higher total amount of intensity in precursor spectra  indicates a
   stronger MS1 signal.</p>
   
   
   <p>The <strong>Total Ion Current </strong>includes contributions from peptides, contaminates, and noise. <strong>Total Ion Current</strong> is only calculated  during the <a href="retention_spread.php">"Retention Spread"</a>, the time period when most peptides are eluting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Higher:</strong> Stronger signal makes it easier to detect peptides.</p>

  The most reproducible <strong>LC-MS</strong> performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric means your process is not reproducible.
</p><div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div>
 <p>Too little <strong>Total Ion Current</strong> means that little signal is getting to the <strong>MS</strong>. Little signal means it is unlikely that peptides will be detected.</p>
 <p>Too high <strong>Total Ion Current</strong> may mean that too 
   much sample was loaded, or that there is a lot of contamination.

 <p>The <strong>Total Ion Current</strong> is the total absolute signal available for peptides (and contaminants 
   and noise).  The<a href="ms1_peak_intensity.php"> Peak Intensity </a>is one measure of how much of this ion current is devoted to  peptides. &nbsp;The <a href="ms1_signal_to_noise.php">MS1 Signal to Noise</a> gives another 
   indication of how much of this total ion current is useful peaks. High <strong>Total Ion Current</strong> without a similarly high <a href="ms1_peak_intensity.php">Peak Intensity</a> may indicate contaminants.
 </p><p>A high <strong>Total Ion Current</strong> will usually mean the the ion trap gets filled quickly so that the <a href="ms1_ion_inject_time.php">MS1 Ion Inject Time</a> should be low. If it is not, that could indicate a problem.
