    <p><strong>Spray Instability</strong> measures how often the  ion current jumps or falls by more than 10 times between adjacent scans.
    </p><p>A <strong>Spray Instability</strong> number  greater than zero indicates electrospray instability or sputtering of the spray tip.
    </p>
    <p>The <strong>Spray Instability</strong> metric counts how many times the MS1 total ion current jumps or falls by a factor of 10 from one scan to the next. This metric is calculated over the time period defined by the "<a href="retention_spread.php">Retention Spread</a>", that is the middle of the retention time when most of the peptides are eluting.</p>

    <p><strong>Zero:</strong> Any positive number indicates a problem.
    </p><blockquote>
    <p>For most metrics, the acceptable range of values is determined by the past performance of the <strong>LC-MS</strong>.  The <strong>Spray Instability</strong> metric is different since the only acceptable value is zero.  </p></blockquote>
    <div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div>
    <p class="blurb">A non-zero value for the <strong>Spray Instability</strong> metric means that the electro-spray is erratic.  </p>
    <div class="heading">Related Metrics: </div>
    <p>The <strong>Spray Instability</strong> is only measured during the part of the elution defined by the <a href="retention_spread.php">Retention Spread</a> metric. An unstable spray at the being or end of the elution time is not reflected in this metric.
