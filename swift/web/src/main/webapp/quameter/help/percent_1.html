<p><strong>Percent +1H</strong> tells the percentage of all spectra ions with a charge of +1.</p><p><strong>Higher percentages of +1H </strong>spectra may indicate inefficient ionization in the electrospray.
</p><p><strong>Percent +1H</strong> is calculated by looking at the charge state of all spectra that match to a peptide.</p>

  </p><p> The most reproducible <strong>LC-MS</strong> performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric means your process is not reproducible.
</p><div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div> 
<p>A high <strong>Percent +1H </strong>means that there are an unusual number of +1 ions. This might mean that the peptides are not ionizing efficiently and so are not getting doubly charged as is normal in electrospray.
</p><p>It might also mean that a large number of polymer or other contaminate ions are in the sample. These molecules may preferentially ionize as charge +1.

<p>Large <strong>Percent +1H</strong> means that the other charge states don't get as many ions. The metrics <a href="percent_3h.php">Percent +3H </a>and <a href="percent_4h.php">Percent +4H</a> also report the ion's charge state. Any ions that are not charge +1, +3, or +4 are probably charge +2.</p>
<p>If the distribution of charge differs, it may affect the size of the peptides that are detected. Another way to look at this is with the metric <a href="precursor_mz.php">Precursor m/z</a>.
