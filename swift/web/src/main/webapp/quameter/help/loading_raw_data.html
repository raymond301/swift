        Loading RAW Files - Thermo RAW Data Dependent MS/MS Data
    </div>
    <p>
        Loading your
        <strong>
            RAW files
        </strong>
        into
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        is a simple process. These files must have been generated by a
        <strong>
            Thermo LTQ Series
        </strong>
        mass spectrometer for them to work in
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        .

    <p>
        To select files to load into
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        , you simply click the button in the picture above and a standard file directory dialogue box will appear:

        <img alt="Load Data Dialogue" height="616" src="new_images/load_data_dialogue.png" width="557"/>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Please note:
        </strong>
        it is very important that you load at least
        <strong>
            25 Quality Control Standard Thermo RAW Data Dependent MS/MS files
        </strong>
        . If you load less than
        <strong>
            25 files
        </strong>
        , the ranges in
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        will not be computed. Once you have highlighted your samples and clicked
        <strong>
            Open
        </strong>
        , your data will begin going through the
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        pipeline:

        <img alt="Files In Process" height="441" src="new_images/files_analysis_in-process.png" width="564"/>

    <p>
        After your files are done, you can click the
        <strong>
            Dashboard
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
            Control Charts
        </strong>
        tabs and view your data in
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
