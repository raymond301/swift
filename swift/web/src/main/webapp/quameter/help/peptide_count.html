<p><strong>Peptide Count</strong> is the number of unique peptides.
	
	</p><p>Higher numbers of unique identified tryptic peptides indicate generally improved instrument performance, making <strong>Peptide Count </strong>a good overall  measure.
	
	</p><p>The <strong>Peptide Count</strong> metric is the number of  unique tryptic peptide sequences identified. Modified versions of the peptide do not add to the <strong>Peptide Count</strong>. Also ignored in this count are multiple spectra matching the peptide and ions with different  charge states.

</p><p>The most reproducible <strong>LC-MS</strong> performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric means your process is not reproducible.
	  </p><div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div>
		<p>The <strong>Peptide Count</strong> metric measures the overall effectiveness of the <strong>LC-MS</strong> system for identifying peptides. Since it measures the overall health of the instrument, <strong>Peptide Count</strong> is not particularly useful for diagnosing problems with particular components of the <strong>LC-MS</strong> system.
