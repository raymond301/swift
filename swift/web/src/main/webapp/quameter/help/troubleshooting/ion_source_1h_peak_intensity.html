        Peak Intensity and +1H Ions
    </div>
    <p>
        It is common in mass spectrometry labs to use a variety of chemical agents to modify or otherwise help with the
        preparation of your
        <strong>
            tryptic digests
        </strong>
        . We use
        <strong>
            Dithiothreitol (DTT)
        </strong>
        to reduce the disulfide bonds in proteins as well as
        <strong>
            Iodoacetic Acid (IAA)
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
            Iodoacetamide (IA)
        </strong>
        to alkylate these cysteine residues to keep the protein unraveled for analysis.

        Another common reagent used in Biochemistry labs is
        <strong>
            Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)
        </strong>
        .
        <strong>
            PEG
        </strong>
        is also a by-product of the production of Triton, and a common degradation product. PEG has been observed coming
        from low-binding pipette tips, which have been exposed to acidic conditions, as well as many other older or
        degraded plastic products. Unfortunately, PEG is considered a contaminant, and it can frustrate the mass
        spectrometrist. PEG often can cause metrics such as
        <a href="../metrics/percent_1h.html">
            Percent +1H Ions
        </a>
        and
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_peak_intensity.html">
            MS1 Peak Intensity
        </a>
        to increase. If you don't know what you are looking for, this polymer can lead to considerable contamination.
    </p>

    <p>
        We start in this example with an increase in the percentage of
        <a href="../metrics/percent_1h.html">
            +1H Ions
        </a>
        :

    </p>

    <p>
        Upon closer examination, we see in the
        <strong>
            Control Charts
        </strong>
        that this increase is indeed a result of
        <strong>
            PEG contamination
        </strong>
        (from a substance such as Triton X-100):

             width="584"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        And to confirm this diagnosis, we look to the
        <strong>
            characteristic PEG fragmentation
        </strong>
        (m/z difference of 44 Da) mass spectrum:
