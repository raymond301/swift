        Peak Widths and Tailing
    </div>
    <p>
        If you have operated an LC-MS system for any length of time, you have probably encountered this common issue:
        <a href="../metrics/peak_width_variability.html">
            Peak Width Variability
        </a>
        and peak tailing.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is clear from the
        <strong>
            MassQC Dashboard
        </strong>
        that there is an issue with
        <a href="../metrics/peak_width.html">
            Peak Widths
        </a>
        :

             width="504"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        When you click on the
        <strong>
            Control Charts
        </strong>
        to get a closer look, a clear trend emerges:
    </p>

        <img alt="Peak Width Variability Trend" height="397" src="../new_images/peak_width_variability.png"
             width="648"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>
            Please note that after the LC
            <strong>
                column
            </strong>
            was changed the metric evens out and is stable for the next several QC runs.
        </em>
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to using
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        to view your LC-MS system performance, it can be helpful to go back and take a look at your mass spectra. Here
        is a picture of the extracted ion chromatogram before the column was replaced (note that the peak is zoomed in
        so that the
        <strong>
            tailing
        </strong>
        can clearly be seen):
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="Peak Tailing" height="207" src="../new_images/tailing_mass-spectra.png" width="455"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        After the
        <strong>
            column
        </strong>
        was changed, a nice,
        <strong>
            tight chromatographic peak
        </strong>
        is present (again, note the scale of the x-axis: although this peak is not zoomed, it is clear that the tailing
        is gone):
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="Tailing Absent" height="179" src="../new_images/no-tailing_mass-spectrum.png" width="405"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        And, finally, after the
        <strong>
            column
        </strong>
        was changed the
        <strong>
            MassQC Dashboard
        </strong>
        shows the metrics are well within the accepted historical range:
