        Mass Accuracy

    <p>
        As we have seen here previously, often one metric being out of line can lead to the discovery that another is
        out of line. This is a powerful feature of MassQC: several metrics are correlated, and when looking only at the
        mass spectra, we are limited to what we see. The instrument could, in fact, be operating at less than optimal.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the present case, the
        <strong>
            MassQC Dashboard
        </strong>
        clearly shows
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_spectra.html">
            Dynamic Sampling
        </a>
        issues, but also
        <a href="../metrics/mass_accuracy.html">
            Mass Accuracy
        </a>
        seems to be out of range:

        What we notice here in addition to the
        <a href="../metrics/ms2_spectra.html">
            Dynamic Sampling
        </a>
        metrics being out of range is that the
        <a href="../metrics/mass_accuracy.html">
            Mass Accuracy
        </a>
        metric is clearly out of range compared to historical data:
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="High Mass Accuracy" height="249" src="../new_images/high_mass_accuracy.png" width="495"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of this high Mass Accuracy metric being out of range, this instrument should be closely examined after
        this red flag. Whatever the lab technician did at this point helped because the trend shows some stability in
        this metric.
