        <a href="../metrics/spray_instability.html">
            Spray Instability

        is a common
        <strong>
            Ion Source
        </strong>
        issue that most
        <strong>
            mass spectrometrists
        </strong>
        will encounter some time or another. Often, this can be a dramatic problem, easily seen by looking through the
        mass spectra. In this case, you will notice a sudden drop-off, as if the liquid simply stopped coming through
        the
        <strong>
            electrospray needle
        </strong>
        . For this run, it occurred continuously throughout the entire run:

             width="599"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        However, in other cases, the
        <a href="../metrics/spray_instability.html">
            Spray Instability
        </a>
        interference can be more subtle. Here we analyze how a tool such as
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        can alert a technician to a
        <strong>
            spray disturbance
        </strong>
        , although you may not see it in the mass spectra. By looking at the
        <strong>
            MassQC Dashboard
        </strong>
        , it is apparent that there is a
        <a href="../metrics/spray_instability.html">
            Spray Instabilit
        </a>
        y issue:
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="Spray Instability Out of Range" height="207" src="../new_images/spray_instability_dashboard.png"
             width="526"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        Although we have highlighted one out of range run above in the
        <strong>
            Dashboard
        </strong>
        , below we see several that are out of range:
    </p>

        <img alt="Spray Instability Control Charts View" height="230"
             src="../new_images/spray_instability_controlcharts.png" width="676"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        From a previous out of range run, we can see how
        <strong>
            subtle the instability
        </strong>
        issue really is. In this case, the
        <strong>
            mass spectrometer
        </strong>
        data don't show the typical interruption pattern seen above. Rather, here the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_total_ion_current.html">
            Total Ion Current
        </a>
        and
        <strong>
            base peak chromatogram
        </strong>
        look normal:

             width="673"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        But as we have seen here before, upon closer examination, we notice the
        <a href="../metrics/spray_instability.html">
            Spray Instability
        </a>
        interruptions happening quite frequently, but at the very low end of the intensity.
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        flagged a run that otherwise may not have been caught by the technician:
