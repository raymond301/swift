        MS1 Signal Saturation
    </div>
    <p>
        Often we see
        <strong>
            signal saturation
        </strong>
        when sensitivity is above average.

        From the
        <strong>
            Dashboard
        </strong>
        view in MassQC, you can clearly see that the
        <strong>
            MS1 metrics
        </strong>
        are very high and out of range. The
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_ion_inject_time.html">
            Ion Inject Time
        </a>
        actually went down because there were more ions going into the trap quickly, thereby filling it up faster. If
        you want to get a closer look at how this compares to your historical data, you would click the
        <strong>
            Control Charts
        </strong>
        tab. Below, we see that the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_dynamic_range.html">
            Dynamic Range
        </a>
        at the MS1 level is quite high, further indicating that
        <strong>
            signal saturation
        </strong>
        has occurred:

        A good example of several metrics reinforcing an obvious
        <strong>
            over-saturation
        </strong>
        diagnosis. So what causes this type of saturation? Several factors come into play here. You could have loaded
        <strong>
            too much sample
        </strong>
        ,
        <strong>
            triggering
        </strong>
        could be occurring on
        <strong>
            noise
        </strong>
        or unimportant peaks,
        <a href="../metrics/spray_instability.html">
            Spray Instability
        </a>
        affects cause signal to jump periodically, to name a few. Most importantly, you now have several clues to
        further troubleshoot your cause for
        <strong>
            saturation
        </strong>
        .
