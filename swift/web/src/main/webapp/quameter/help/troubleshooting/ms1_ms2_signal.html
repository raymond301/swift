        After the ions at the
        <strong>
            MS1
        </strong>
        level come through, the methods described herein rely upon a second level of mass analysis to occur. This would
        be the
        <strong>
            MS2
        </strong>
        level and is used to fragment ions further, so that database searches can be performed for protein
        identification. Problems can occur at each of these levels of ionization/mass analysis and often do. In the
        current example, we notice
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_peak_intensity.html">
            Peak Intensity
        </a>
        and
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_total_ion_current.html">
            Total Ion Current
        </a>
        at the
        <strong>
            MS1
        </strong>
        level and
        <a href="../metrics/ms2_high_intensity_id_rate.html">
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </a>
        and
        <a href="../metrics/ms2_ion_inject_time.html">
            Ion Inject Time
        </a>
        at the
        <strong>
            MS2
        </strong>
        level:

    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if the technician looks more closely at the
        <strong>
            MS1 metrics
        </strong>
        that were flagged, by clicking the
        <strong>
            Control Charts
        </strong>
        , you see why
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        is flagging these runs. They are clearly going out of range, until finally they are very high and the instrument
        needs to be looked at closely:

        <img alt="MS1 Upward Trend Metrics" height="371" src="../new_images/MS1_metric_upward_trend.png" width="673"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        If we take a look at the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_total_ion_current.html">
            Total Ion Current
        </a>
        for the flagged run, we clearly see that the run is bad. In this case, the technician might hypothesize that
        some contamination has occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="Increased Total Ion Current" height="330" src="../new_images/increased_TIC.png" width="505"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        One possibility is that
        <strong>
            acetate cluster ions
        </strong>
        likely arose from placing a metallic filter in the chromatography system while using acetic acid in the running
        buffers. The series of ions builds slowly over a period of runs. The contaminate ions dominate the
        <strong>
            base peak chromatograms
        </strong>
        , as seen above.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the kind of problem that can grind a lab to a halt for a period of time. Expectedly, MassQC flags the
        problem as some of the metrics have varied wildly from their long-term averages.
