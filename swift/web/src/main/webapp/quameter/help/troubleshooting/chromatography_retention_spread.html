        Looking at the liquid chromatogram can often lead to diagnosis of an LC problem. We first look to the
        <strong>
            MassQC Dashboard
        </strong>
        to see what metrics are out of range, if any:

             width="482"/>
    </p>

        In addition to the
        <a href="../metrics/retention_spread.html">
            Retention Spread
        </a>
        being out of range, the number of
        <a href="../metrics/peptide_count.html">
            Peptide Counts
        </a>
        is out of range (low) as well:

        As we move from viewing the
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        <strong>
            Dashboard
        </strong>
        to the
        <strong>
            Control Charts
        </strong>
        , we notice that, indeed, the historical data agree with the alerts. This graph shows a QC run that is way our
        of range:

    </p>

        Since
        <a href="../metrics/retention_spread.html">
            Retention Spread
        </a>
        is an LC problem, we may ask the question: what is causing this Retention time shift and how is the
        <a href="../metrics/peptide_count.html">
            Peptide Count
        </a>
        data related? For this we look to the mass spectrum to see if there is something wrong with the
        <strong>
            liquid chromatogram
        </strong>
        :

    </p>

        Looking at XCalibur, there appears to be some split in the chromatography. Material is eluting very early and
        towards the end, with not much in-between. Likely causes: flow rate slowed due to
        <strong>
            partial clog in the chromatography column
        </strong>
        ; LC pump not smoothly transitioning through the aqueous/organic solvent gradient.
