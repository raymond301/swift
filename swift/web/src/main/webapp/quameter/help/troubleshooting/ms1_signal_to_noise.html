        can tell you a lot about how well your
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        system is running or the quality of your samples. If you know that your QC standard is at a concentration that
        gives good signal historically, then it follows that if the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_signal_to_noise.html">
            Signal to Noise
        </a>
        metric is out of range for your QC standard, something is wrong with the
        <strong>
            MS1
        </strong>
        and/or
        <strong>
            MS2
        </strong>
        ionization process.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this current example, we see that several
        <strong>
            MS1/MS2
        </strong>
        metrics are out of range:

    </p>

    <p>
        Here we will focus on the
        <strong>
            MS1
        </strong>
        metrics. When the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_signal_to_noise.html">
            MS1 Signal to Noise
        </a>
        is out of range, particularly when it is low, this usually means that there are not any real peptide peaks
        coming off the column. This could be due to several reasons. Perhaps some sample was lost along the way, either
        in the sample preparation stage or through the use of a bad LC column. Whatever the reason, we also notice that
        the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_dynamic_range.html">
            Dynamic Range
        </a>
        is low as well. This correlates nicely with the low
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_signal_to_noise.html">
            Signal to Noise
        </a>
        , since the
        <a href="../metrics/ms1_dynamic_range.html">
            Dynamic Range
        </a>
        is the difference between the lowest and highest MS1 peaks.
