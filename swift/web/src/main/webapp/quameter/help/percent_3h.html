   <p><strong>Percent +3H</strong> is the percentage of all spectra  that have a charge of +3.
   
   </p><p>Higher <strong>Percent +3H</strong> indicates that the mass spectrometer may favor long peptides.
   
   </p><p><strong>Percent +3H </strong>is calculated by looking at the charge state of all spectra that match to a peptide

</p><p> The most reproducible <strong>LC-MS</strong> performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric means your process is not reproducible.
</p><div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div> 
<p>A high <strong>Percent +3H </strong>means that there are an unusual number of plus 3 ions. This might mean that the electrospray is behaving erratically.

</p><div class="heading">Related Metrics:</div>
<p>Large <strong>Percent +3H</strong> means that the other charge states don't get as many ions. The metrics <a href="percent_1h.php">Percent +1H </a>and <a href="percent_4h.php">Percent +4H</a> also report the ion's charge state. Any ions that are not charge +1, +3, or +4 are probably charge +2.</p>
<p>If the distribution of charge differs, it may affect the size of the peptides that are detected. Another way to look at this is with the metric <a href="precursor_mz.php">Precursor m/z</a>.
