   	<p><strong>Percent +4H</strong> is the percentage of all spectra matching peptides that have a charge of +4.</p>
   
   	<p>Higher <strong>Percent +4H</strong> indicates that the mass spectrometer may favor long peptides.</p>
   
   	<p><strong>Percent +4H</strong> is calculated by looking at the charge state of all spectra that match to a peptide.</p>

<div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div> <p class="blurb">A high <strong>Percent +4H </strong>means that there are an unusual number of plus 4 ions. This might mean that the electrospray is behaving erratically..</p>

<div class="heading">Related Metrics:</div>
<p>Large <strong>Percent +4H</strong> means that the other charge states don't get as many ions. The metrics <a href="percent_1h.php">Percent +1H </a>and <a href="percent_3h.php">Percent +3H</a> also report the ion's charge state. Any ions that are not charge +1, +3, or +4 are probably charge +2.</p>
<p>If the distribution of charge differs, it may affect the size of the peptides that are detected. Another way to look at this is with the metric <a href="precursor_mz.php">Precursor m/z</a>.</p>
