        <p><strong>Search Score</strong> is the score assigned by the software (the search engine) that associates the spectra with the peptides. 
      </p><p>Higher <strong>Search Scores</strong> correlate with a higher frequency of good identifications of peptides. 
      </p><p>The <strong>Search Score </strong>metric depends upon the analysis method used when loading the standard sample. <strong>MassQC</strong> supports simple standard samples.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Simple standard samples</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> A common simple sample is <strong>BSA</strong> but in general simple samples have only a few proteins. For these samples, the analysis method specifies that the search engine will be <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/" target="_blank">OMSSA</a>.
  </p><ul>
          <li><strong>Search Score</strong> is the log of the <strong>OMSSA</strong> e-value. </li>
          <li>The <strong>Search Score</strong> metric is the median search score for all peptides.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>OMSSA</strong> has a standard threshold that all peptide to spectrum matches must pass before the peptide is considered identified.

      </p><div class="heading">Units:</div> 
        <p>For <strong>OMSSA</strong>, the <strong>Search Score</strong> is the <strong>log of the e-value</strong>.
      </p><div class="heading">Optimal:</div> 
        <p><strong>Higher:</strong> Good Search Scores correspond to peptides which are solidly identified.
      </p><p>The most reproducible <strong>LC-MS</strong> performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric means your process is not reproducible.
      </p><div class="heading">What the Metric Detects:</div>
      <p>The <strong>Search Score </strong>tells how good the MS2 spectra are in the sense of how easily they are matched to peptides by a search engine. Low values of the <strong>Search Score</strong> may be caused by: </p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Contaminants which cause chemical noise and extra non-identifiable peaks in the spectrum </li>
            <li>In-source decay which causes the b and y ion peaks used by search engines to fragment </li>
            <li>Poor fragmentation which is seen as only a few peaks in the MS2 spectrum and is perhaps caused by incorrect collision energy</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="heading">Related Metrics: </div> 
    <p>Spectra with high <strong>Search Scores </strong>are easily identified by search engines because they have a good <a href="ms2_signal_to_noise.php">MS2 Signal to Noise</a>, have a reasonable number of <a href="ms2_peaks_per_spectrum.php">Peaks per Spectrum </a>and the major peaks in the MS spectrum are the fragment ion peaks of the peptide.
