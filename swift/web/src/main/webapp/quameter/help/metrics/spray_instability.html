        <strong>
            Spray Instability
        </strong>
        measures how often the ion current jumps or falls by more than 10 times between adjacent scans.

    <p>
        A
        <strong>
            Spray Instability
        </strong>
        number greater than zero indicates electrospray instability or sputtering of the spray tip.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Spray Instability
        </strong>
        metric counts how many times the MS1 total ion current jumps or falls by a factor of 10 from one scan to the
        next. This metric is calculated over the time period defined by the "
        <a href="retention_spread.html">
            Retention Spread
        </a>
        ", that is the middle of the retention time when most of the peptides are eluting.

        <p>
            For most metrics, the acceptable range of values is determined by the past performance of the
            <strong>
                LC-MS
            </strong>
            . The
            <strong>
                Spray Instability
            </strong>
            metric is different since the only acceptable value is zero.

    <p class="blurb">
        A non-zero value for the
        <strong>
            Spray Instability
        </strong>
        metric means that the electro-spray is erratic.

        The
        <strong>
            Spray Instability
        </strong>
        is only measured during the part of the elution defined by the
        <a href="retention_spread.html">
            Retention Spread
        </a>
        metric. An unstable spray at the being or end of the elution time is not reflected in this metric.
