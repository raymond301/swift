    <p>
        <strong>
            Signal to Noise
        </strong>
        estimates how strong the signal is, that is how much larger the large peaks in the spectrum compared to the the
        background noise.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Signal to Noise
        </strong>
        indicates the strength of the signal that can be used to identify peptides.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            MS2 Signal to Noise
        </strong>
        metric is estimated by taking the ratio of the maximum to the median of the fragment ion peak heights. The
        <strong>
            Signal to Noise
        </strong>
        metric is calculated for the MS2 spectra that are matched to a peptide.
        <strong>
            Signal to Noise
        </strong>
        looks only at peak heights: it does not taking into account which peaks are the b or y fragment ions.

        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
