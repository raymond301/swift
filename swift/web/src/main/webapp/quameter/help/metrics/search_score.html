        <strong>
            Search Score
        </strong>
        is the score assigned by the software (the search engine) that associates the spectra with the peptides.

    <p>
        Higher
        <strong>
            Search Scores
        </strong>
        correlate with a higher frequency of good identifications of peptides.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Search Score
        </strong>
        metric depends upon the analysis method used when loading the standard sample.
        <strong>
            MassQC
        </strong>
        supports simple standard samples.

            Simple standard samples

        A common simple sample is
        <strong>
            BSA
        </strong>
        but in general simple samples have only a few proteins. For these samples, the analysis method specifies that
        the search engine will be
        <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/" target="_blank">
            OMSSA

    <p>
        <strong>
            OMSSA

        identified.

        For
        <strong>
            OMSSA

        , the
        <strong>
            Search Score
        </strong>
        is the

            log of the e-value

        Good Search Scores correspond to peptides which are solidly identified.

        The most reproducible
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        What the Metric Detects:
    </div>
    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Search Score
        </strong>
        tells how good the MS2 spectra are in the sense of how easily they are matched to peptides by a search engine.
        Low values of the
        <strong>
            Search Score
        </strong>
        may be caused by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Contaminants which cause chemical noise and extra non-identifiable peaks in the spectrum
        </li>
        <li>
            In-source decay which causes the b and y ion peaks used by search engines to fragment
        </li>
        <li>
            Poor fragmentation which is seen as only a few peaks in the MS2 spectrum and is perhaps caused by incorrect
            collision energy
        </li>
    </ul>

        Spectra with high

            Search Scores

        are easily identified by search engines because they have a good
