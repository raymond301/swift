        <strong>
            Oversampling
        </strong>
        is the fraction of all peptides that have been identified by more than one spectra.
    </p>

    <p>
        Repetitive acquisition of the same peptides can indicate that the dynamic sampling settings on the instrument
        need to be adjusted.

        A high value of
        <strong>
            Oversampling
        </strong>
        indicates that you are sampling the same peptide over and over rather than sampling different peptides. In the
        experimental setup where spectra counting is used to estimate the protein quantities, the ideal level of
        <strong>
            Oversampling
        </strong>
        may be different than in the experimental setup where the emphasis is on detecting as many different peptides as
        possible.

    <p>
        Note that some repetitive sampling can be good if the sample that will be run after the standard is expected to
        have a much higher peptide density (higher concentration) than the standard itself.

        The most reproducible
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

    <p>
        If
        <strong>
            Oversampling
        </strong>
        changes it may mean that the sampling parameters in the method such as trigger level, dynamic exclusion list
        length or dynamic exclusion time have changed.

            Oversampling
