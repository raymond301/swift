        Percent Semi-Tryptic
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Semi-Tryptic Peptides
        </strong>
        are peptides which were cleaved at the C-Terminal side of arginine (R) and lysine (K) by trypsin at one end but
        not the other. The figure below shows some semi-tryptic peptides.

    <p>
        Higher prevalence of
        <strong>
            Semi-Typtic Peptides
        </strong>
        can indicate digestion preparation problems. It could also indicate that the instrument sensitivity is above
        average. For example, the instrument was able to detect low abundance
        <strong>
            Semi-Tryptic Peptides
        </strong>
        it normally would have missed.

        The
        <strong>
            Percent (%) Semi-Tryptic
        </strong>
        metric is the percent of all identified peptides that are semi-tryptic.

        For protein standards, the digestion should not be a variable step in the process. This is sometimes done by
        buying or making batches of samples that were all digested at once.

        The most reproducible
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        What the Metric Detects:
    </div>
    <p>
        If the digestion of the sample is different, then the
        <strong>
            Percent (%) Semi-Tryptic
        </strong>
        will be different. This means that the standard being run this time does not have the same distribution of
        peptides as in other standards runs. This may affect all the other metrics.
