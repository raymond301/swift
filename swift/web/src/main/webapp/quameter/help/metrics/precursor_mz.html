        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        is a measure of the mass/charge for the precursor ions seen in MS1.

            High or low m/z

        The
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        metric is the median value of m/z for all identified spectra.

        The most reproducible
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        What this Metric Detects:
    </div>
    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        metric reports the m/z where the mass spectrometer is tuned to best detect peptides. Changes in this "sweet
        spot" are reflected by changes in the
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        metric.
    </p>

    <p>
        A high value of
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        could also be caused by inefficient digestion so that there are multiple missed cleavages. Missed cleavages will
        result in longer peptides and thus larger
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        .
    </p>

    <p>
        Higher values can correlate with inefficient ionization, while lower values can correlate with short,
        non-specific peptide identifications.

        The
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        depends on the charge state of the spectra that were matched to peptides. In contrast the
        <a href="percent_1h.html">
            Percent +1H
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="percent_3h.html">
            Percent +3H
        </a>
        , and
        <a href="percent_4h.html">
            Percent +4H
        </a>
        metrics report on all the detected ions whether they match to a peptide or not. If these related metrics are out
        of bounds, but
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        isn't, then it may mean that there are an unusually large number of non-peptide ions in the sample.
    </p>

    <p>
        If
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        is unusually small, it may be because of non-specific digestion resulted in short peptides. These short peptides
        might be detected in a larger than normal
        <a href="percent_semi_tryptic.html">
            Percent Semi-Tryptic
        </a>
        .
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        also goes up if more sample is loaded. This might be because there is a higher concentration of peptides
        available to be chosen with a fewer charges per peptide. If this is the reason for higher
        <strong>
            Precursor m/z
        </strong>
        , then the
        <a href="ms1_total_ion_current.html">
            Total Ion Current
        </a>
        should also be higher. In general, the more potential peptides your sample contains the more accurate this
        metric is.
