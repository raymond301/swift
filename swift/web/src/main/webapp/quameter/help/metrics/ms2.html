                Peaks per Spectrum
            </a>
            is the number of fragment ion peaks in the MS2 spectrum.

                High-intensity ID Rate
            </a>
            is the percentage of the more intense MS1 peaks that get identified as a peptide.

                Low-intensity ID Rate
            </a>
            is the percentage of the least intense MS1 peaks that get identified as a peptide.

            <a href="ms1_signal_to_noise.html">
                Signal to Noise
            </a>
            estimates how strong the signal is, that is how much larger the large peaks in the spectrum compared to the
            the background noise.

            <a href="ms2_ion_inject_time.html">
                Ion Inject Time
            </a>
            is the time in milliseconds that it takes to fill the ion trap.
