        Low Intensity Trigger Point

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        is. for low abundance peptides, the intensity on the
        <strong>
            extracted ion chromatogram (XIC)
        </strong>
        curve where the where the MS2 scan is triggered.
    </p>

    <p>
        High value of the
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        mean that the mass spectrometer is efficiently sampling the signal for the lower intensity MS2 scans. A low
        value for
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        means that only a small portion of the available signal is being used for peptide identification.
    </p>

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        metric is the percentage of the maximum MS1 peak which is sampled for MS2. The metric is the median value of
        this measurement over all the times that MS2 is sampled. For this calculation only the smaller half of the MS1
        peaks are considered.

        What the Metric Detects:
    </div>
    <p>
        Under ideal circumstances, chromatographic peaks would be sampled at their maximum intensity. That is, the
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        metric would be 100%.
        If the
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        is too low, there may be insufficient ion current for the MS2 spectra triggered from low intensity MS1 peaks to
        have a signal-to-noise ratio that is adequate for successful peptide identification.

        The
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        is the same as the
        <a href="trigger_point.html">
            Trigger Point
        </a>
        except it is calculated only for the MS1 peaks with low intensity. Only peaks less than the
        <a href="ms1_peak_intensity.html">
            Peak Intensity

        Since the
        <strong>
            Low Intensity Trigger Point
        </strong>
        is a percentage of the peak height, an unusually high
        <strong>
            Trigger Point
        </strong>
        may indicate that there are many peaks just above the trigger point. In other words the MS/MS instrument may set
        to trigger MS2 scans at a very low intensity, that is, it is triggering on noise. An unusually low

        or high

            Signal to Noise
        </a>
        metric may be further symptoms of too low a trigger point.
