                Peptide Count
            </a>
            is the number of unique peptides.

                Percent Semi-tryptic
            </a>
            are peptides which were cleaved at the C-Terminal side of arginine (R) and lysine (K) by trypsin at one end
            but not the other. The figure below shows some semi-tryptic peptides.

                Search Score
            </a>
            is the score assigned by the software (the search engine) that associates the spectra with the peptides.

                Mass Accuracy
            </a>
            is the difference between the mass observed with the mass spectrometer and the known mass of the peptide
            precursor molecule.
