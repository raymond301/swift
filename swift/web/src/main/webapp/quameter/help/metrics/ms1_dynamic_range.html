        <strong>
            Dynamic Range
        </strong>
        is the range of MS1 peak intensities that allows for detection of peptides.

        Higher
        <strong>
            Dynamic Range

        , that is, a larger difference in intensity between the smallest and largest MS1
        peaks, can indicate improved sensitivity.

        The
        <strong>
            Dynamic Range
        </strong>
        metric is the ratio of a high intensity MS1 peak (which is more intense than 95% of the peaks) to a low
        intensity MS1 peak (which is less intense than 95% of the peaks). This metric only considers MS1 peaks that have
        an MS2 spectrum that has been matched to a peptide. It also only considers MS1 peaks that elute during the

            "Retention Spread,"
        </a>
        the elution time span where most of the peptides are eluting.

        The most reproducible

            LC-MS

        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        The
        <strong>
            Dynamic Range
        </strong>
        measures how much signal is available for detecting peptides. This measure is sensitive to the amount of sample
        loading into the
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        system.

        A higher
        <strong>
            Dynamic Range
        </strong>
        is one way to see if the mass spectrometer is able to see less abundant peptides in the presence of more
        abundant peptides.

        A higher
        <a href="ms1_peak_intensity.html">
            Peak Intensity

        available ion current is being used for peptide identification.

        A higher value of the

            Low Intensity Trigger Point

        means that the less abundant peptides are getting a lot of the available ion current.

        <a href="ms2_low_intensity_id_rate.html">
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </a>
        means that these less abundant peptides are being identified.
