        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        is the middle part of the retention time.Â One quarter of the peptides elute earlier; one quarter of the peptides
        elute later. One half of the peptides elute during the Retention Spread period.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the period where the peptides are eluting the closest together. It is this critical time period that
        most stresses the LC system's ability to separate peptides.
    </p>

    <p>
        Greater
        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        means that the peptides elute over a longer period of time which in turn indicates better separation of peaks.

        The most reproducible

            LC-MS

        What the Metric Detects:
    </div>
    <p>
        An ideal standard protein sample will have peptides that elute over a range of times that is similar to times
        when peptides from biologically significant samples elute. Typically with reverse phase chromatography, there
        are only a relatively few hydrophilic peptides that elute early and relatively few hydrophobic peptides that
        elute late. The bulk of the peptides elute in the middle during the
        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        .

    <p>
        A change in
        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        may indicate that the gradient has changed. For example, because the buffers have changed, the time it takes for
        the middle 50% of peptides to elute increases; blockages in LC system can cause
        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        to lengthen; improper solvent mixing can also increase or decrease
        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        .

        Since this is the most critical region of the LC run, the
        <strong>
            Retention Spread
        </strong>
        is used as the basis for the calculation of a number of other metrics. The metrics

        metric may be unreliable.
