        <strong>
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        is the percentage of the more intense MS1 peaks that get identified as a peptide.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        measures the efficiency of sampling and detection.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        is calculated from only the most intense MS1 peaks. The most intense peaks are those in the top 25% ranked by
        the MS1 maximum intensity. The metric is the percentage of these intense peaks that the search engine matches to
        a peptide.

        The most reproducible
        <strong>
            LC-MS

        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        What the Metric Detects:
    </div>
    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        tells what fraction of peaks with stronger signals are matched to peptides. If this metric is unusually low,
        that may mean that the higher intensity peaks are noise.

        Whereas the
        <strong>
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        measures how efficiently the high intensity MS1 ions are matched to peptides, the
        <a href="ms2_low_intensity_id_rate.html">
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </a>
        does the same thing for the low intensity MS1 ions. In general the
        <strong>
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        is expected to be larger than the
        <a href="ms2_low_intensity_id_rate.html">
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </a>
        and it is worth investigating if it is not.
