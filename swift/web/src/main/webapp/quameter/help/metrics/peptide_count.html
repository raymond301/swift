    <p>
        <strong>
            Peptide Count
        </strong>
        is the number of unique peptides.

    <p>
        Higher numbers of unique identified tryptic peptides indicate generally improved instrument performance, making
        <strong>
            Peptide Count
        </strong>
        a good overall measure.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Peptide Count
        </strong>
        metric is the number of unique tryptic peptide sequences identified. Modified versions of the peptide do not add
        to the
        <strong>
            Peptide Count
        </strong>
        . Also ignored in this count are multiple spectra matching the peptide and ions with different charge states.

        The most reproducible
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Peptide Count
        </strong>
        metric measures the overall effectiveness of the
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        system for identifying peptides. Since it measures the overall health of the instrument,
        <strong>
            Peptide Count
        </strong>
        is not particularly useful for diagnosing problems with particular components of the
        <strong>
            LC-MS
        </strong>
        system.
