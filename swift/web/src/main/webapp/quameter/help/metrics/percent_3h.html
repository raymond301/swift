        <strong>

        is the percentage of all spectra that have a charge of +3.

        Higher
        <strong>

        <strong>
            Percent +3H
        </strong>
        is calculated by looking at the charge state of all spectra that match to a peptide

        The most reproducible

        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        What the Metric Detects:

    <p>
        A high
        <strong>
            Percent +3H
        </strong>
        means that there are an unusual number of plus 3 ions. This might mean that the electrospray is behaving
        erratically.

        Large
        <strong>
            Percent +3H
        </strong>
        means that the other charge states don't get as many ions. The metrics
        <a href="percent_1h.html">
            Percent +1H
        </a>
        and
        <a href="percent_4h.html">
            Percent +4H
        </a>
        also report the ion's charge state. Any ions that are not charge +1, +3, or +4 are probably charge +2.

        If the distribution of charge differs, it may affect the size of the peptides that are detected. Another way to
        look at this is with the metric
        <a href="precursor_mz.html">
            Precursor m/z
