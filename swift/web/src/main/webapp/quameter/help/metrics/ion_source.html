        The Metrics that Describe the Ion Source:
    </div>
    <p>
        An unusual number of any of the +1, +3, +4 ions may indicate problems with the electrospray source. Also they
        may indicate the instrument needs to be returned, as it may not be set up to ideally detect peptides.
    </p>

    <p>
        An excess of very short peptides or very long peptides can be detected by looking at the overall precursor m/z.

            <a href="percent_1h.html">
                Percent +1H
            </a>
            is the percentage of all spectra that have ions with a charge of +1.
        </li>

            <a href="percent_4h.html">
                Percent +3H
            </a>
            is the percentage of all spectra that have ions with a charge of +3.

            <a href="percent_4h.html">
                Percent +4H
            </a>
            is the percentage of all spectra that have ions with a charge of +4.

                Spray Instability

            measures how often the ion current jumps or falls by more than 10 times between adjacent scans.

            is a measure of the mass/charge for the precursor ions seen in MS1.
