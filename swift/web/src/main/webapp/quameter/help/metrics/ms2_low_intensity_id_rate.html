        <strong>
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        is the percentage of the least intense MS1 peaks that get identified as a peptide.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        measures the efficiency of sampling and detection amongst the lowest intensity signals.

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        is calculated from only the least intense MS1 peaks. The least intense peaks are the lowest 25% ranked by the
        MS1 maximum intensity. The metric is the percentage of these low strength peaks that the search engine matches
        to a peptide.

        The most reproducible

        performance is when this metric remains in a narrow range over a series of runs. Wide variability in any metric
        means your process is not reproducible.

        What the Metric Detects:

    <p>
        The
        <strong>
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        tells what fraction of peaks with weaker signals are matched to peptides. If this metric is unusually low, that
        may mean that the mass spectrometer has lost sensitivity.

        Whereas the
        <strong>
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        measures how efficiently the low intensity MS1 ions are matched to peptides, the
        <a href="ms2_high_intensity_id_rate.html">
            High Intensity ID Rate
        </a>
        does the same thing for the high intensity MS1 ions. In general the
        <strong>
            Low Intensity ID Rate
        </strong>
        is expected to be smaller than the
        <a href="ms2_high_intensity_id_rate.html">
            High Intensity ID Rate

        and it is worth investigating if it is not.
